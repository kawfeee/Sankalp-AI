 Section-3. Relevance of Proposed Project
 3.1 Current Status of the Technology
 Current methane detection technologies deployed in underground mines rely heavily on catalytic
 combustion sensors, infrared optical sensors, and metal-oxide semiconductors. These systems, although
 proven, face major limitations including low sensitivity to sub-ppm methane levels, slow response time,
 susceptibility to poisoning, high power consumption, and cross-interference from gases like CO₂, CO, and
 2
H₂S. Nanomaterial-based sensing platforms, especially those using multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs),
 have demonstrated significant promise due to high surface-to-volume ratios, tunable electronic properties,
 and functionalization feasibility. Electrostatic deposition is emerging as a superior technique for achieving
 uniform nanotube coatings with controlled orientation and density. However, integration of functionalized
 MWCNTs with field-ready methane sensor modules is still at a nascent stage, with no indigenous systems
 fully developed for Indian mines. Existing studies are mostly academic with limited field validation.
 3.2 Significance of the Project
 This project directly addresses methane-induced hazards in underground coal mines by developing an
 advanced sensing platform capable of selective, sensitive (>100 ppm), and low-power detection.
 Functionalized MWCNTs combined with electrostatic deposition promise a breakthrough in sensor response
 time, selectivity, durability, and operational stability in harsh mining conditions. The sensor will support
 early-warning systems, reduce explosion risks, improve productivity, and support methane capture
 initiatives. Indigenous development of this technology will reduce dependence on imported sensors,
 fostering self-reliance under Atmanirbhar Bharat. The project further contributes to environmental
 commitments related to methane emission reduction, making mining safer and sustainable.
 Section-4. Project Work Summary
 4.1 Detailed Objectives
 The project aims to design, develop, and validate a highly selective methane sensing system based on
 functionalized MWCNTs. Detailed objectives include: - Develop electrostatic deposition parameters for
 uniform MWCNT layer formation on sensor substrates. - Functionalize MWCNTs with Pd, SnO₂, and
 polymeric groups to enhance methane adsorption and electron transfer. - Perform complete
 physicochemical characterization using SEM, TEM, BET, Raman, FTIR, and XRD. - Fabricate a sensor module
 using interdigitated electrodes, microcontroller interface, and wireless data acquisition. - Benchmark sensor
 performance in controlled laboratory conditions. - Validate sensor performance in BCCL underground
 testing facilities. - Prepare guidelines for commercial-scale prototype deployment.
 4.2 Technical Details
 The project integrates nanomaterials engineering, device fabrication, and real-world testing. MWCNTs will
 undergo purification, acid oxidation, and functionalization using chemical and physical routes. Electrostatic
 deposition equipment will be optimized for controlled charging and deposition cycles to achieve nano
uniform coatings. Gas-sensing experiments will rely on resistance modulation principles measured through
 precision source meters. Calibration will be conducted across a concentration range of 50–5000 ppm
 methane. Sensor packaging will ensure protection against humidity and dust. Software algorithms will
 interpret resistance change patterns to enhance accuracy. Field validation will involve methane exposure
 tunnels at BCCL, ensuring robustness against cross-gases.

This research proposal aims to develop an advanced methane detection system for underground coal mines using electrostatically deposited and functionalized multiwall carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The project falls under the Technology Development Programme (TDP) with a focus on advanced materials, gas-sensing technologies, and mining safety. With a current Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 3, the work intends to transition from laboratory proof-of-concept to field-validated sensor prototypes over a planned 24-month duration and an estimated budget of ₹78.50 lakhs.

Methane leakage remains one of the most significant safety threats in Indian underground coal mines, causing explosions, operational shutdowns, and substantial economic losses. Existing sensor technologies—catalytic, infrared, and metal-oxide—face issues such as slow response, cross-gas interference, and limited sensitivity. Functionalized MWCNTs offer superior surface reactivity, tunable properties, and high sensitivity, making them promising candidates for next-generation methane sensors. However, there is currently no indigenous, field-validated solution for Indian mining environments.

This project proposes the design and fabrication of a selective methane sensor using Pd-, SnO₂-, and polymer-functionalized MWCNTs deposited uniformly via electrostatic deposition. The work includes material synthesis, functionalization, SEM/TEM/Raman characterization, sensor module fabrication with interdigitated electrodes and microcontroller integration, laboratory calibration (50–5000 ppm), and field validation at BCCL’s methane exposure facilities. The outcome will be a low-power, fast-response sensor capable of selective methane detection in harsh underground environments.

Amity Institute will lead material synthesis and device fabrication, while BCCL will support real-world testing and deployment. The project strengthens national efforts in methane mitigation, supports Mine Safety Directorate goals, reduces dependence on imported sensors, and contributes to the Atmanirbhar Bharat mission. Deliverables include validated sensor prototypes, deployment guidelines, characterization datasets, and potential patent filings, ensuring both scientific advancement and industrial impact.
